ABOUT
=====

LibGeoDecomp (Library for Geometric Decomposition codes) is a generic
library for stencil codes. Users can build custom computer simulations
(e.g. engineering or natural sciences problems) by encapsulating their
model in a C++ class. This class is then supplied to the library as a
template parameter. The library essentially relieves the user from the
pains of parallel programming, but is limited to applications which
perform space- and time-discrete simulations with only local
interactions.

Its modular architecture makes it applicable to various architectures
(e.g. multi core CPUs, GPUs, MPI clusters). For more details and a
user guide see http://www.libgeodecomp.org

BUILDING
========

For compiling LibGeoDecomp you'll need cmake (http://www.cmake.org) installed.
We recommend an out-of-source build:

  BUILD_DIR=build/`uname -ms | sed s/\ /-/g`
  mkdir -p $BUILD_DIR
  cd $BUILD_DIR
  cmake ../../src/
  make 

That's it. CMake will output a number of configure options. You can
change these by specifying their valued via "-D NAME=value", e.g.

  cmake -D FEATURE_CUDA=false ../../src/

...turns CUDA support off. This may be handy in case CMake did detect
CUDA, but you don't have a compatible GPU installed. Additionally you
may want to run the library's unit tests via "make test" to ensure
that it's actually working. For speedier builds you may want to run
make in parallel, e.g. "make -j 4". Replace the 4 by the number of
cores in your system. For more details please refer to:
