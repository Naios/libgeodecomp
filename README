LibGeoDecomp (Library for Geometric Decomposition codes) is a generic
library for stencil codes. Users can build custom computer simulations
(in most cases natural sciences or engineering problems) by describing
their model in a C++ class. This class is then supplied to the library
as a template parameter. The library essentially relieves the user
from the pains of parallel programming, but is limited to this class
of applications. Its modular architecture makes it applicable to
various architectures (e.g. multi core CPUs, GPUs, MPI clusters). For
more details see and a user guide http://www.libgeodecomp.org
