This is the TypemapGenerator, a simple code generator to automate the
construction of MPI datatypes for custom C++ classes. Rather than
parsing the source code itself, it relies relies on Doxygen's XML
output. It will produce a class "Typemaps", located in the files
"YOUR_PATH/typemaps.{h,cpp}". This class will contain the MPI code
create the neccessary extended struct derived datatypes. The
TypemapGenerator will only generate datatypes for its friends.

To get an idea how it's working, have a look at the demonstation
project in "./sample". The "compile.sh" script exhibits the three
phase build process: (a) parsing via Doxygen, (b) code generation
using the TypemapGenerator and (c) compilation using Make.

INSTALLATION
============

You will probably want to integrate the TypemapGenerator into your build
process (similar to "compile.sh"). How this is done will depend on
your setup.
